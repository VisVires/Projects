	Jackson and Pollock
		3 site test
		Men
			Chest
			Abdominal
			Thigh
		Women
			Tricep
			Suprailliac
			Thigh
		Calculating Body Density For men, the body density formula is as follows: Body Density = 1.10938 â€“ (0.0008267 x the sum of the chest, thigh and abdomen skin folds in mm) + (0.0000016 x square of the sum of chest, abdomen and thigh) - (0.0002574 x age). For women, the body density formula is as follows: Body Density = 1.0994921 - (0.0009929 x sum of thigh, triceps and suprailiac skin folds) + (0.0000023 x square of the sum of thigh, triceps and suprailiac skin folds) - (0.0001392 x age in years).

		To calculate body fat percentage, divide 495 by the body density, then subtract 450 and multiply by 100 (Kasch).

Sloan Equation
	Males
		Body Density = 1.1043 - (0.001327 x thigh skinfold in mm) - (0.00131 x subscapular skinfold in mm), based on a sample aged 18-26. 
	Females
		Body Density = 1.0764 - (0.0008 x iliac crest skinfold in mm) - (0.00088 x tricep skinfold in mm), based on a sample aged 17-25. 
	Body Fat %
		% Body Fat = (495 / Body Density) - 450.
